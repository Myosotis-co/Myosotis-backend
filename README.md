# DeleteMeHere
In a world where almost every online service requires you to create an account, it's easy to lose track of all the websites and apps you've signed up for. Many of these services offer trial periods and if not monitored closely, one could end up with a long list of unwanted subscriptions or even worse, surprise charges on your credit card.

This is where DeleteMeHere comes in. Our application is designed to empower users to take control of their digital footprint. It offers a simple and efficient way to view and manage all your online accounts in one place.
